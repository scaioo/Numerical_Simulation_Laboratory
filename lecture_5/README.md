# lecture 5

## Structure
In this lecture the  exercise is divided into two `.cpp` files. The files can be compiled all together with the command `make` and then can be executed with `./*Execise_<exercise_number>*`.
- The `Exercise_05.1.cpp` file perform the Metropolis algorithm for the ground and excited state starting close to the origin so no equilibration is needed.
- The `Exercise_05.1_far.cpp` file perform the Metropolis algorithm for the ground and excited state starting far from the origin. Simulation with and without equilibration are perfomed.

## Usage
- To compile only one file the command is `make` *Exercise_<exercise_number>*.
- In the `Results` directory can be found the outputs.
- To remove all thee objects files created the command is `make clean`.
